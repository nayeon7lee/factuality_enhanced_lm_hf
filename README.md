# Factuality Enhanced Language Models for Open-Ended Text Generation (HF)
![License: Apache](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache2.0-yellow.svg) 

This code is built on top of [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) github repository from Huggingface. 

Purpose of this repository is to provide an easy way for researchers to replicate our work:
"[Factuality Enhanced Language Models for Open-Ended Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04624.pdf)", _Nayeon Lee, Wei Ping, Peng Xu, Mostofa Patwary, Mohammad Shoeybi, and Bryan Catanzaro_. 

For factuality evaluation metrics used in this paper, please refer to <https://github.com/nayeon7lee/FactualityPrompt>.
